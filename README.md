# Number-of-Orders-Prediction-with-Machine-Learning

- Predicting the number of orders for a product is one of the strategies a business can follow in determining how much to invest in marketing their product. So, predicting the number of orders is an important data science use case for product-based companies.

# Number of Orders Prediction
- If you want to predict the number of orders a company may receive for a particular product, then you need to have historical data about the number of orders received by the company. So for this task, I will be using the sales data of supplements that have been collected from Kaggle. The data that I will be using for the task of the number of orders prediction contains data about:

- Product ID
- Store ID
- The type of store where the supplement was sold
- The type of location the order was received from
- Sales Date
- Region code
- Whether it is a public holiday or not at the time of order
- Whether the product was on discount or not
- Number of orders placed
- Sales
- Now in the section below, I will take you through the task of the number of orders prediction with machine learning by using the Python programming language.
